## Security Review Process

### 1. Automated Security Checks

All pull requests must pass automated security checks before human review:

#### CodeQL Analysis
- Static application security testing (SAST)
- Scans for common security vulnerabilities
- Checks for dangerous coding patterns
- **Status**: Must pass before merge

#### Dependency Scanning
- Scans all dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- Checks for outdated packages with security issues
- Validates license compatibility
- **Status**: Must pass before merge

#### Secret Detection
- Scans for hardcoded secrets, API keys, passwords
- Checks commit history for exposed credentials
- Validates environment variable usage
- **Status**: Must pass before merge

#### SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- Multiple tools: Semgrep, SonarQube (if configured)
- Custom security rules for project-specific patterns
- Code quality and security analysis
- **Status**: Must pass before merge

### 2. Manual Security Review

#### When Required
- All pull requests touching security-sensitive code
- Changes to authentication/authorization logic
- Database schema modifications
- API endpoint additions/modifications
- Configuration changes
- Third-party integrations
- File upload functionality
- Payment processing code

#### Security Reviewer Requirements
- Must have security training certification
- Familiar with OWASP Top 10
- Experience with secure coding practices
- Knowledge of project architecture

- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Log injection prevention

**Configuration & Dependencies**
- [ ] Secure configuration practices
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Environment-specific configurations
- [ ] Dependency vulnerabilities addressed
- [ ] Minimal privilege principle followed

### 3. Emergency Security Fixes

For critical security vulnerabilities:

#### Fast-Track Process
1. **Immediate Assessment** (within 1 hour)
   - Severity assessment using CVSS
   - Impact analysis
   - Exploit likelihood evaluation

2. **Emergency Review** (within 4 hours)
   - Security team lead review required
   - Automated checks can be bypassed if necessary
   - Post-deployment verification required

3. **Documentation Requirements**
   - Security incident report
   - Root cause analysis
   - Prevention measures
   - Post-mortem review

#### Emergency Contacts
- **Primary Security Contact**: [security lead email]
- **Secondary Contact**: [backup security reviewer]
- **Escalation**: [CTO/Security Officer]

### 4. Security Training Requirements

#### For All Developers
- OWASP Top 10 training (annual)
- Secure coding practices workshop (bi-annual)
- Security tools training (quarterly)
- Incident response procedures (annual)

#### For Security Reviewers
- Advanced secure code review training
- Threat modeling certification
- Security testing methodologies
- Compliance requirements training

### 5. Compliance and Audit

#### Regular Security Audits
- Monthly code review process audit
- Quarterly security posture assessment
- Annual third-party security audit
- Continuous compliance monitoring

#### Documentation Requirements
- All security reviews documented
- Review decisions and rationale recorded
- Security training completion tracked
- Incident response actions logged

### 6. Metrics and KPIs

#### Security Review Metrics
- Average time to security review completion
- Security issues found per review
- False positive rate of automated tools
- Post-deployment security issues

#### Process Improvement
- Monthly security review retrospectives
- Tool effectiveness evaluation
- Process optimization based on metrics
- Feedback incorporation from development team

### 7. Tool Configuration

#### GitHub Security Settings
```yaml
# Repository Security Settings
security:
  vulnerability_alerts: enabled
  security_advisories: enabled
  secret_scanning: enabled
  dependency_graph: enabled
  
# Branch Protection Example (via GitHub CLI or API)
branch_protection:
  main:
    required_status_checks:
      strict: true
      contexts:
        - "CodeQL Analysis"
        - "Dependency Vulnerability Scan"
        - "Secret Detection"
        - "Semgrep SAST"
    enforce_admins: true
    required_pull_request_reviews:
      required_approving_review_count: 1
      dismiss_stale_reviews: true
      require_code_owner_reviews: true
    restrictions: null
    allow_force_pushes: false
    allow_deletions: false
```

### 8. Integration with Development Workflow

#### Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks for security
pre-commit install

# Example hooks:
# - Secret detection
# - Code formatting
# - Basic security linting
# - Dependency checking
```

#### IDE Integration
- Security plugins for VSCode/IntelliJ
- Real-time vulnerability detection
- Secure coding suggestions
- Automated fix suggestions

### 9. Incident Response Integration

#### When Security Issues Are Found
1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Stop deployment if in progress
   - Assess immediate risk
   - Notify security team

2. **Investigation**
   - Root cause analysis
   - Impact assessment
   - Affected systems identification

3. **Remediation**
   - Fix development and implementation
   - Testing and validation
   - Deployment coordination

4. **Post-Incident**
   - Documentation update
   - Process improvement
   - Team communication
